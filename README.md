# Transparent Accounts Android App

Browse Czech transparent bank accounts via the ČS/Erste sandbox public API, built with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose.  

This sample is wired to the sandbox environment.
**Before building:** add your Erste API key to `local.properties` (auto‑ignored by Git):

```properties
EDP_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

That's it — sync & run.
